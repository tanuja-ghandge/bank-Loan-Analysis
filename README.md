    Bank Loan Performance, Risk & Repayment Insight

 2.Dashboard Discription
   The Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of a bank’s loan portfolio by analyzing key metrics such as total loan amount, number of customers, loan count, interest rates, and repayment status. The dashboard visually presents loan performance trends over time and breaks down data by state, loan     grade, verification status, and home ownership.
   It enables users to quickly understand how loans are distributed, how customers are performing in terms of repayment, and where potential credit risks exist.   

3.Purpose of the dashboard
  The main purpose of this dashboard is to:
  
      a) Monitor overall loan performance and growth trends
   
      b) Analyze customer behavior and repayment patterns
   
      c) Identify high-risk loan segments based on grades, states, and loan status
   
      d) Support data-driven decision-making for loan approvals and risk management
   
     E) Help financial institutions improve profitability and reduce defaults
   
     f) Provide management with a single, interactive view of loan insights

 5.Feature & Highlight 
 
   a) Problem Statement
   
       Banks need to analyze loan performance to understand:
       
            How much loan amount is disbursed
            
            Customer repayment behavior
            
            Risk based on loan grade, sub-grade, and verification status
            
            Trends over time (year-wise loan disbursement)
            
            However, raw loan data is complex and not easy to interpret for decision-making.


  b) Goal of Dasboard
     To provide a clear overview of bank loan performance across years.
     
     To analyze total loan amount, number of loans, and total customers.
     
     To understand loan trends over time (year-wise growth).
     
     To compare loan status (Charged Off, Current, Fully Paid).
     
     To evaluate customer risk and credit quality using grade and sub-grade.
     
     To analyze state-wise loan distribution.
     
     To track average interest rate and its impact on loans.
